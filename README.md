# TheFlavour

This is my test task for Kodisoft Internship 2016. It's a simle site about "The Flavour" restaurant.

>**To start this project on your Windows machine you have to:**
>- have Microsoft Visual Studio installed;
>- have Microsoft SQL Server Express LocalDB installed
to render data from a local database I use as a single `App_Start/Dishes.mdf` file;
>- press F5 button in your Visual Studio to start ISS Server :D

And try to find a cute doggy when you'll be searching through the blog articles.
